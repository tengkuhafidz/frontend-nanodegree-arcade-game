# Frogger - Classic Arcade Game

## How The Game Works

The goal of the game is to reach the water (top of the board) without colliding into any of the bugs. 
The bugs will be moving across the board at random speeds.
Use your arrow keys on your keyboard (left, right, up and down) to move.

Have fun!
